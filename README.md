# *Marcellus Bursey Personal Website*

I created a personal website for future use when opportunities arise where it's needed. Let's say, for example, a career fair, an internship, and an interview. Having this personal website will come in handy and prove useful. It displays information about me, my resume, what projects I've done, what organizations I belong to, and how to contact me. 

The following features are implemented in the project:

- [ ] A navigation bar to switch between each section

- [ ] A way for you to type your information and send a message to me.

## Project Design:

Here's a mockup and design of the project:

## Notes and Comments

I greatly enjoyed making this website as well as seeing the code that makes up my websites. It shows how powerful coding is and how important it is to a website. Playing around with the code of the website fascinates me because it shows what coding is capable of when you know the language and what the parameters and syntaxes are. My website is simple for now, that's what's mainly important for making a website, but I will revise this when I want it to show me and my personality. For right now, this is good, and I will leave it as it is. I can't wait to learn HTML so I can make my website greater than what it is now.
